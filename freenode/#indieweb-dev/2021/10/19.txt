I was not sure about implementing it because there was this very discussion going on in the GitHub Issue. One thing on my mind is that h-x-app (or h-app) may evolve in the future to include more attributes f more consumers pick up the format which is why I think exploring different options like a manifest is interesting. But I feel that is out of scope for an IndieAuth client discovery ","modes":[]}
