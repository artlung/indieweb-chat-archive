Atom and RSS are XML formats, and they _only_ specify the feed description document--on my site it's the one called `index.xml`. Specifically, Atom and RSS do not specify any particular format for the post itself--there's no RSS\/Atom \"microformat\" that describes the content within a page the feed points to. Is that right?","modes":[]}
