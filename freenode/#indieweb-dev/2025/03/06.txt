The previous question I had posted was specific to an error I'm getting using the indieweb_auth module in my Drupal site. When I go to the indieweb login page it indeed redirects me back to my Drupal site, where I authorize the third party. It then redirects back to the indieweb site which gives me an error. I'd have to look back through the messages to find the error. Thank you,","modes":[]}
